									<p class="about_text">
										I am a new Developer; eager for the opportunity to combine past experiences and education with, 
										more recently acquired skills in Web Development and Cloud Computing.  &nbsp;Earlier in life, 
										I acquired a degree in Journalism, from Delaware State University.  &nbsp;As a young journalist, 
										I worked in both news and advertising environments and utilized skills in layout & design, 
										technical writing, image processing and Editing.
										<br><br>
										Throughout my life, I have found that I really enjoy creating, and in recent years, 
										I have really enjoyed creating with my computer.  &nbsp;I have found that I tend to become completely absorbed, 
										when I engage in electronic creativity.  &nbsp;In an effort to satisfy my desire to create, 
										I taught myself to use a variety of popular software applications for processing images, 
										music and video.  &nbsp;In addition, I learned to use templates in order to create websites and blogs. 
										&nbsp;Therefore, it seemed a logical next step to become formally educated in Web Development and Cloud Computing.
										<br><br>
										At Delaware County Community College, I have achieved academic honors while acquiring core development skills in areas such as; 
										Responsive Web Design, Front and Back-End Programming, Database Management, Networking and Cloud Architecture.  
										&nbsp;Upon completion, this fall, I will receive the College&apos;s certification in Web Development.
										<br><br>
										My goal is to combine past experiences with newly acquired skills, to create dynamic, 
										feature-rich web content and cloud-based applications.

										This site was created for a class project and was, actually, my first “scratch-built” website.  
										&nbsp;I decided to create it after noticing that the borough, in which I reside, lacked an adequate digital presence. 
										<br><br>
										The borough&apos;s situation provided a “real-world” opportunity to create a relevant website, for my class project.  
										&nbsp;In addition, it also presented a genuine business opportunity and chance to learn beyond the scope of my class. 
										&nbsp;Therefore, this site was created as a working sample that could be “pitched” to the borough, when completed.
										<br><br>
										In spite of being originally created using HTML & CSS only, the site which I created was better organized 
										and provided greater functionality than the site, which the borough used, at that time.

										This application was created to gain experience making API calls.  
										&nbsp;At start-up, the application detects the location of the user&apos;s device by making an API call for its geo-location.  
										&nbsp;It then uses the information, returned, to make a second API call to obtain weather information, for that location.  
										&nbsp;The local weather is then displayed. &nbsp;In addition, the user is provided with the ability to enter a different location, 
										and receive weather information remotely. 
										<br><br>
										The application, also, includes functions which accurately determine and display the time, wind direction and weather description, 
										for the selected location.
										<br><br>
										I, later, learned to create API endpoints, with which to receive calls, by using AWS for backend services.

									<p class="about_text">
										To gain experience with the use of plugins, I created this application just for fun.  
										&nbsp;All of the input elements were created using plugins from one source or another. &nbsp;The submission button generates a dialogue box which displays the user&apos;s inputs, 
										prior to submission.  &nbsp;The same method is used to confirm user input on the “contact” page of my portfolio, before sending data to the back-end.
